01.12.2021 During the meeting, Colin advised me I should contact Ivan Nikitin- another student who had worked with quiche, a Rust implementation of QUIC. This was due to the fact that Ivan had had problems with Mio and Tokio, which had been the subject of discussion the previous week when rustls was discussed. I agreed to contact Ivan to share ideas. Furthermore, I explained that I had re-implemented TLS over TCP using tokio-rustls, therefore removing the need for Mio as tokio-rustls solely uses Tokio.
