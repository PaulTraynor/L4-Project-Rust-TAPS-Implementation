08.12.2021 We discussed the developments in the project since the previous meeting. I shared that I had spoken with Ivan Nikitin, who had told me about Quinn- another Rust implementation of QUIC. Since them, I had re-implemented QUIC using Quinn. I also explained that I had started implementing the candidate gathering phase of connection establishment and was about to begin connection racing. Colin said I should create an up to date API design document that we could discuss in the next meeting. I agreed to do this in advance of the next meeting.
