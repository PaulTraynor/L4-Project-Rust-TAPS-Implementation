15.12.2021 The main discussion of the meeting focused on the API document I had sent in advance of the meeting, detailing what structs, enums and methods are available to the application and how important concepts from TAPS are were represented in this implementation. Colin advised that I should consider changing the implementation of Connections and Listeners to be traits rather than structs and that the initiate() and listen() methods should return impl Connection and impl Listener respectively, thus removing an unnecessary layer of abstraction and taking away the need for the send(), receive(), close() and abort() methods to be defined again in separate a separate struct, in the case of Connections. We also discussed a better way for remote endpoints to be represented, which would involve an array of potential IP addresses, when a host name and port had been specified by the application. Furthermore, we discussed how long the system should wait before attempting the next connection/listener. Colin said the 200ms I had in place already was perhaps too long and that 20 or 30ms would be more appropriate, given how long users are accustomed to waiting in normal cases for connections to be established when using the internet.
