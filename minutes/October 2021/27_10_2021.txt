27.10.2021 We started the meeting with a brief discussion about the selection properties from the TAPS API specification and Colin informed me that it would be ok to extend these as I saw fit. Colin then explained some issues and questions to do with the API design document I has sent prior to the meeting. Firstly, these concerned the connection trait; Colin thought there should be a type parameter where the type in question implements a protocol trait. Secondly, the framer solution I had provided did not cater for cases where an incomplete message had been received. Thus, Colin pointed me in the direction of a Rust library, nom, for parsing. Furthermore, Colin explained more work was needed on Messages, and encouraged thought on how they should be represented and whether they should be linked to a protocol. Lastly, the format of Remote Endpoints was discussed and their representation as traits rather than a struct with many fields will be looked at more closely. I agreed I would look further at the design and develop something we could discuss in the next meeting.
