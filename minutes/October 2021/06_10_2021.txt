06.10.2021 We discussed the requirements document and plan that I had sent before the meeting. We agreed that the best way forward was still to hold off beginning the coding, and to instead focus on the design of the API and further requirements analysis. Colin advised me to come up with a more formal requirements document, to clearly lay out priorities and less important but desirable outcomes for the project. We also agreed that in the meantime, experimental can be done with external libraries I plan to use, such as quiche.
