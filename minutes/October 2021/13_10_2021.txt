13.10.2021 We discussed the new requirements document I had sent before the meeting and agreed that more structure was needed. Therefore it was decided that I come up with a new requirements analysis document using the MOSCOW structure, along with an API design and a timeline for the project. We also discussed appropriate HTTP versions to be used with the various transport protocols that will be used in the project. Colin advised that it would be a good time to start the coding after the next meeting.
