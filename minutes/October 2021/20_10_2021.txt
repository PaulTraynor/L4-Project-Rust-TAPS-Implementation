20.10.2021 We discussed the document I had provided in advance of the meeting containing updated requirements in MOSCOW format, a timeline for the project and a diagram showing the design of the API. The first two were agreed to be fine but the diagram required more work to become more detailed and relevant to the Rust programming language. Colin informed me that a good way forward to improve the design was to figure out what works and what doesn't by starting the programming and returning to the diagram to improve it. A methodology called type driven development was discussed to achieve this and will be explored further before the next meeting. In advance of the next meeting I will also begin the coding, according to the timeline, and redo the API design diagram.
