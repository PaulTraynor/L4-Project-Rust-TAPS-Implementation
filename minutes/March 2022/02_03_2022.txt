02.03.2022 The meeting again focused on the dissertation. Colin advised a description and discussion of how to use the API was necessary in the API chapter. Colin also advised that the discussion of what transport protocols were chosen should be removed from the Internals chapter and that some of the method signatures should be looked at further. Colin said that there was too much code in the Internals chapter and that more explanations and diagrams were needed. Colin also identified some further areas for discussion such as the relative benefits of using Tokio against async-std and the increased complexity of this API implementation against the simplicity of its use.
