09.03.2022 The main discussion of the meeting was around the developments in the Evaluation chapter. Colin advised that more comparisons between this API and sockets were necessary. This included the convenience that this kind of API offers; no time consuming extensions to sockets are necessary if this API is used. The complexity to do this every time such extensions are required all goes into one API, where there is the simplicity of its interface. Colin said the background chapter had seen improvements but that diagrams were required for Post Sockets and TAPS.
