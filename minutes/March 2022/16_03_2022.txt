16.03.2022 The discussion of the meeting covered the first draft of the dissertation that had been sent prior to the meeting. Colin advised that there should be discussion of the development process of the reimplementation of Messages, which had been carried out since the last meeting. Colin also advised that the discussion of the Apple Network.framework in the background chapter should include a discussion on the use cases and resulting decisions made for this API, which is more tailored to mobile devices. More context was also needed in the background, before the discussion points. Colin said the requirements chapter had the necessary parts in place, but that some structural changes were necessary. This would involve discussion of the requirements after introducing them, for each level of requirements in MOSCOW. Colin said that the summary of the project should go at the end of the Conclusion chapter and that the Evaluation should contain more discussion on the comparisons with sockets.
