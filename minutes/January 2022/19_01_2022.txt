19.01.2022 We started the meeting talking about the difficulties I had been having with certificates and private keys, particularly when testing locally with my TLS/TCP implementation. Colin explained a common issue where using different versions of rustls leads to errors and I said I would check if this could be going on in my code. I also updated Colin on my work to connect to QUIC test servers running HTTP/0.9. I said that I had been unable to connect, with connections simply timing out and I asked whether it's possible that the ALPN header could be causing the issue. Colin said that it may be the case that such a server's more basic approach might not even accept ALPN headers. Colin also gave me some materials for researching Post Sockets and informed me of another project in this space, NEAT, that I could discuss in my dissertation. On the same subject, we discussed when it might be appropriate to start work on the dissertation. Colin explained it wasn't necessary right now, but that it would be a good idea to sketch out a plan of chapters for the dissertation for next week.
