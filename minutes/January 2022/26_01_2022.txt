26.01.2022 The meeting focused on the structure of the dissertation. Before the meeting, I had come up with a rough plan for the dissertation and I went through this with Colin during the meeting. Colin also shared a GitHub page he had created which showed a formulaic approach to writing introductions for papers that I could use. When discussing the evaluation part of the dissertation, Colin gave me the idea of using Mininet to test the API, given my experience of using this during the Advanced Networked Systems course. Colin also mentioned a PhD student who had used Mininet, explaining that the student had composed a Makefile to automate the entire process of starting the VM, creating a topology and running tests, before depositing the results as graphs in a Latex file. I agreed this would be a great approach to take when working on the evaluation.
