12.01.2022 We discussed the progress that had been made over the holiday, namely the re-implementation of Connections and Listeners as traits, to enable a more flexible design. I also informed Colin that I had successfully managed to connect to remote hosts using QUIC but that I had been unable to communicate further due to a lack of a HTTP/3 library as Quinn does not have one. Colin said there were some QUIC test servers running HTTP/0.9 that might still be active that I could use to fully test my implementation. We also discussed what work would be done over the next few weeks, including reading that I could do. This included reading about Berkeley Sockets, Post Sockets, TAPS and the various async socket implementations in programming languages such as Python and Go. The intention here is to talk about what makes them different and to discuss the developments in this space over the years in the dissertation.
