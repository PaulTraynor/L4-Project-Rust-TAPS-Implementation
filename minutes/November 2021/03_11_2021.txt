03.11.2021 We discussed framing in more detail with Nom, and further discussed potential designs for a framer and how one could be implemented, as well as what the return type should be from a parse method. We then discussed the Listener object from the TAPS API and how the listen() method would work in practice. I asked questions relating to how the Listener would return Connection objects to the application. Colin informed me that a stream of Connections objects should be returned and advised I research Tokio- a Rust asynchronous library. Colin also advised that I should experiment with asynchronous networking code in Python and then using Tokio, before using it in the project.
