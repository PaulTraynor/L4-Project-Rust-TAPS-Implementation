18.11.2021 We discussed the progress that had been made on the project over the previous two weeks (previous meeting was cancelled due to IETF). I informed Colin that I had implemented all of the QUIC code and had experimented with implementing a HTTP request parser using nom. Colin advised that a real HTTP parser would require a significant amount of work, a project in itself. We agreed that a basic, proof of concept parser like the one I had made could be appropriate given that this is not the focus of the project or, alternatively, a fully-built external HTTP parser could be used. I informed Colin of my next steps, to implement TLS over TCP, and of my research into Tokio and of my intention to adopt its use in the project to make the API asynchronous.
