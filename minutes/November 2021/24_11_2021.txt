24.11.2021 We discussed the changes to the project made since the last meeting, namely the implementation of TLS over TCP using rustls. I explained that existing examples of code using this library used mio for asynchronous I/O. Colin informed me that another student had had trouble getting Tokio to work with mio. It had been my intention to use Tokio throughout the project for asynchronous I/O so Colin shared other possible TLS over TCP libraries I could try. We discussed the next steps for the project including transport properties, connection racing and candidate gathering. Lastly, I informed Colin that I would prepare a document detailing the progress that had been made so far as well as the changes left to be made in advance of the next meeting in preparation for the status report required at the end of the semester.
