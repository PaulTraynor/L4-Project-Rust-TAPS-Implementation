16.02.2022 Like the previous week, the meeting centred around the latest draft of the design chapter. Whilst progress had been made, there was still not enough big picture overview. Colin advised it was necessary to show how the different pieces in the API fit together, as well as discussion of what the API actually is, and how it is used. More diagrams were also needed, as well as showing function, trait and struct definitions. It was agreed that a full first draft of the dissertation would be completed by Friday of week 8, three weeks before the deadline. The other chapters of the dissertation were also discussed and it was agreed that before the next meeting a draft of the background and implementation chapters would be sent.
