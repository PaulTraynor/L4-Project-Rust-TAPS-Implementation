09.02.2022 The focus of the meeting was the first draft of the design chapter of the dissertation that had been sent prior to the meeting. Colin advised more high level overviews and more context was needed in the form of code snippets and diagrams. This would, amongst other reasons, show conceptually how objects from TAPS, such as Connections, had been implemented in Rust. It was also necessary to discuss the trade offs of the design process more and why design decisions had been made. The Background chapter was also discussed. Colin advised this would be the ideal place to discuss other developments in the network API space such as the Python async-io module, as well as TAPS itself.
