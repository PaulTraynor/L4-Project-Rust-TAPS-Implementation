02.02.2022 The meeting mainly focused on how Mininet, discussed in the previous meeting, could be used in the project. Colin said the Mininet tests could evaluate what the API is like to program with. Furthermore, that it could be used to demonstrate the working of Candidate Racing as Mininet can emulate real network conditions, and that the API could used in both client and server form with Mininet. The general issue of testing was also discussed in the meeting. The importance of test coverage was raised. Colin explained that although coverage was important, a comparison with sockets was much more important. This was because TAPS seeks to improve on many of the shortcomings of sockets and therefore an evaluation of how well these differences have been implemented in the project was imperative. Lastly, Colin advised that it would be sensible at this stage to begin writing the dissertation for the project, starting with the design chapter.
