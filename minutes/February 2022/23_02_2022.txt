23.02.2022 In the meeting, more discussion was had about the latest draft of the dissertation. Colin advised that the background chapter needed more content. Furthermore, that the API and implementation chapters could be renamed "Interface" and "Internals" as this would be a more natural split, given the nature of the project. Therefore, some parts of the API chapter would be moved to Internals and vice versa. Colin said the overview that had been added to the design chapter was good but a short chapter introduction would be necessary.
